# AMR in Swiss wastewater integrated with clinical resistance data and antibiotic consumption
This repository contains the code for the analyses and the wastewater data for the manuscript entitled: "Integrated analyses of longitudinal trends of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wastewater, clinical resistance data, and antibiotic consumption in Switzerland"


# README

## Repository Overview
The repository includes:
+ All analysis scripts required to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript.
+ Wastewater concentration datasets and Swiss shapefiles needed to generate figures, maps, and summary tables.
+ Pre-defined folder structure, allowing the code to run without modification as long as the directory layout is preserved.

Clinical resistance data and antibiotic consumption data retrieved from ANRESIS are not included in this repository due to data sharing restrictions. These datasets can be requested directly from the corresponding author or through ANRESIS (https://www.anresis.ch).

## How to Use This Repository
+ Download or clone the entire repository.
+ Maintain the provided folder structure (e.g., the data/ directory already contains the correct paths expected by the scripts).
+ Run the analysis scripts to reproduce figures, tables, and statistical outputs from the manuscript.

If you have any questions or require access to restricted data, please contact the corresponding author.
